Welcome to Galactic Defender - My very first game using pygame! ðŸš€<br>
Embark on an adventure as you pilot your spaceship through the vast reaches of space. 
But watch out! ASTEROIDS !!<br>
With simple controlsâ€”just hit the space bar to start your mission and to fire your weapon.
But beware, not all asteroids are created equal. Some are big and slow, making them easy targets, 
while others are small and swift, putting your reflexes to the test. 
Every hit earns you points, with big asteroids netting you 1 point and small ones scoring you 2.
